#<h2>Modeling the Classification of the Animal Kingdom in JavaScript
This project is a JavaScript class that models the classification of the animal kingdom. It applies all four principles of object-oriented programming (OOP): encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or object. In this project, the Animal class is an example of encapsulation, as it contains both data (such as the name and species of the animal) and methods (such as the getName and setSpecies methods) related to the animal.

Abstraction
Abstraction is the principle of exposing only the necessary information and hiding unnecessary details. In this project, the Animal class provides an abstract representation of an animal, allowing users to interact with the object without needing to know the implementation details of how the object works.

Inheritance
Inheritance is the principle of creating new classes that are derived from existing classes. In this project, the Mammal class is derived from the Animal class, and therefore inherits all of the data and methods of the Animal class. This allows the Mammal class to have all of the characteristics of an Animal, as well as additional characteristics that are specific to mammals.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the principle of being able to take on multiple forms. In this project, polymorphism is demonstrated through the use of method overriding. For example, the Animal class has a move method that returns the string "The animal is moving." However, the Mammal class has its own implementation of the move method that returns the string "The mammal is running." When a Mammal object calls the move method, it will use the version of the method that is specific to mammals, rather than the version defined in the Animal class.

Usage
To use the Animal class in your own project, you can simply include the file containing the class definition and create new Animal objects using the new keyword<h2>


##Conclusion
This project demonstrates how the principles of OOP can be applied in JavaScript to model the classification of the animal kingdom. By encapsulating data and methods within objects, abstracting implementation details, using inheritance to create derived classes, and implementing polymorphism through method overriding, we can create a flexible and extensible system for representing animals in code.
